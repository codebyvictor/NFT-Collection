# Building a 10,000 NFT Collection from scratch (Meta Snails)
"NFT sales volumes totaled roughly $24.9 billion in 2021; a tremendous rise from roughly $94.9 million in 2020". Gaining more and more popularity, I decided to create my own collection of Non Fungible Tokens at the beginning of 2022, later developed on the Ethereum Blockchain. I used Adobe Illustrator to draw a first idea of my NFT and decided to make Snails the main concept of my collection. With the objective of creating more than 10k pieces of unique images, I first draw a combination of 5 to 20 images per layer (hats, accessories, colour, shirts...) and combined them with a program.

With each token being assigned to a number, the idea behind the collection was to create pieces of art that could also work as lottery tickets. The revenues generated by the tokens directly redistributed to the winners of the lottery. 

Without any Javascript experience at the time, I followed a github script to construct the full set of Snails (10,000). Overall, this experience taught me how NFTs and the blockchain worked by implementing a unique collection of my own, while strengthening my design, marketing, and finance skills.
